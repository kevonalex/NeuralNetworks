#This project is a follow-up to the Age Restriction Service (ARS) I have designed under the Cinema Age Restriction System repository. By completing this project, I intend to use the image processing method skeleton I have developed using an ANN for feature classification of satellite imagery, and inputting results into a CNN to classify different terrains, e.g. tundra, desert, forest, etc.
